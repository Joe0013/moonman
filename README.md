i don't know what I am doing here.
So i created this github account to pretedn that I am a "programmer" As if this is somehow a romantic thing. 
Like I can write "code" and make something work. 

Been playing with computers for 30+ years. Source of frustrationa nd anger and fascination. anger that tehy never didi for me what I could not do for myself. 
Frustration at the time suck they represented. 
The possibility of excellence, and teh failure of me to achive anythign good cform a machine. 
what woudl I have been without comuters and sheets and word documents? 
Do my years of files mean anythign. 
The fact thjat all of this is gone wiht the strokle of a hammer or an electric bolt is somehow nice. 
It will all be gone in a flash. 

It's only a model.
